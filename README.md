## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

[DriveMetaData](https://www.drivemetadata.com) One Platform For All-In-One Marketing Stacks & Customer Data Platform. [website](https://www.drivemeatadata.com)  and  [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13qg2HF0T6fAkSAZiQcji_0rCONef0LmBzNyMXd2v8SU/edit).

To get started, sign up [here](https://www.drivemetadata.com)

## ðŸŽ‰ Installation

We publish the SDK to `mavenCentral` as an `AAR` file. Just declare it as dependency in your `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
    dependencies {
    implementation 'com.drivemetadata:dmd-android-sdk:1.1.8'
    implementation "com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2"
    }
```

Alternatively, you can download and add the AAR file included in this repo in your Module libs directory and tell gradle to install it like this:

### ðŸ“– Dependencies

Add the Install Referrer library and Android Support Library v4 as dependencies to your Module `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
    dependencies {
    implementation 'com.drivemetadata:dmd-android-sdk:1.1.8'
    implementation "com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2"
}
```


Once you've updated your module `build.gradle` file, make sure you have specified `mavenCentral()` and `google()` as a repositories in your project `build.gradle` and then sync your project in File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.
